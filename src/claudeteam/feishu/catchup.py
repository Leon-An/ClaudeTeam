"""Router catchup-on-restart.

When the router daemon dies (Ctrl-C, OOM, host reboot), the live
`event +subscribe` stream resumes from the moment we re-attach — any
messages the boss sent during the gap are silently lost.

This module bridges that gap:

* `read_cursor` / `write_cursor` persist the last successfully-classified
  message into `state_dir/router.cursor`.
* `pending_lines` calls `chat-messages-list`, filters to messages newer
  than the cursor, and emits NDJSON lines in the same shape the live
  subscribe loop produces — so `subscribe.process_lines` replays them
  without caring whether the source was a Popen pipe or this catchup.

Cursor advances on every classified Decision (route or drop), so a
crash mid-apply means we re-encounter the message and lean on
process_lines' dedup set to skip duplicates.

Two response shapes seen in the wild from `lark-cli im +chat-messages-list`
Specifically:
  - older / fixture: `{body: {content: "..."}, create_time: "<epoch-ms>"}`
  - lark-cli 1.0.21 live: `{content: "...", create_time: "2026-05-03 18:53"}`
The shape-normalisation helpers below accept both.

# The cursor is a MONOTONIC high-water mark (max create_time of any
# classified message), but lark's WebSocket can deliver out of order and,
# on macOS hosts, silently drops for ~120s at a time. So a message can be
# *missed* live while a LATER message gets classified and pushes the cursor
# past it; on the next catchup that earlier message is older than the
# high-water cursor and a bare minute-floor cutoff filters it out forever
# — it never reaches `seen` (so dedup can't help) and the minute floor is
# too coarse to save a cross-minute miss. Stepping the cutoff back by at
# least the disconnect window keeps those earlier-but-unprocessed messages
# in the replay set; the persisted `router.seen` dedup (seeded into
# process_lines across restarts) drops any we already applied, so a wider
# window costs a few dedup-drops, never a re-fire.

    Two precision realms collide here. Cursor is set from the LIVE event
    `create_time` (lark-cli WebSocket → millisecond precision string).
    `messages` come from `chat-messages-list` REST (minute precision
    string like "2026-05-06 14:08", parses to the floor of that minute).
    A strict `>` or even bare `>=` comparison loses the minute the
    cursor is in: cursor 14:08:32.107 vs REST 14:08:00 → REST < cursor
    → every message that shares the cursor's minute is dropped.

    Floor the cutoff to the minute boundary (so same-minute REST messages
    survive) AND step it back by `lookback_ms` (so an out-of-order message
    a few minutes older than the high-water cursor — the cross-minute
    silent-drop miss — survives too). Re-applied messages are harmless:
    `router.seen` (persisted across restarts) and the in-process
    `seen_msg_ids` dedup them; the worst case is replaying ~a window of
    already-seen rows that immediately dedup-drop.

    The lookback is deliberately bounded (not the whole window) so a fresh
    deploy into an active chat doesn't reach back over pre-birth history
    the empty-cursor guard already excludes on first up.

    Bad/missing create_time (parses to 0) gets dropped — never include
